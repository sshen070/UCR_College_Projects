The skeleton of main I provide has a little bit more structure than
the one that is in the Zybooks.

The createVector function is done, but you have to write min_index,
selection_sort, and getElement.

These are supposed to be "templated" functions, but I didn't write
in the template syntax (it is straight forward, but the program
won't work until you put it in place).

When your code is graded, your main will not run.  The unit tests
will simply exercise the three functions you wrote to see if they
work.

Right now, the main has some tests that make a random vector and
tries out getElement.  If you want to try a few things, just
make a.out and run

% ./a.out < test.txt

The main (as written) does not do anything with selection sort,
so you will have to add your own tests to main to make that work.

For selection sort, remember the way it works... you start with
an array of size n (so indices 0 through n-1).  We pick the
smallest value in the range 0:n-1 (with min_index) and SWAP that
into position 0.  Then we pick the smallest value in range 1:n-1
and swap that into position 1 and so on.
